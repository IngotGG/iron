# Reporting a Bug
When reporting a issue to our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/ingotgg/iron/issues) make sure to be as clear and concise as possible.
We need as much information as possible and clear steps to reproduce the issue you had in order to properly fix the bug.

Sometimes bugs may occur due to the unique circumstances of your environment, if you believe this is the case please provide as much information as possible about your environment.

# Fixing a Bug
When fixing a bug and there isn't already an issue open on our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/ingotgg/iron/issues) make sure to open one and link your Pull Request to it
so we know exactly why you're making the changes you are.

Be as clear as possible while making a fix for a bug explaining how the changes you are making will actually fix the issue at hand.

# Making a Suggestion
### New features
When making a suggestion for a new feature in the project make sure to explain exactly how the feature you are requesting will benefit everyone using our project, we sadly cannot implement features just for you so we need good reasons to add new features.

### Codebase improvements
If you're making a suggestion for a possible way to improve our codebase make sure to explain how exactly your change may be more viable than our current solution, we're always looking for ways to improve so make sure to let us know.
